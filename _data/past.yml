  description: "Personal email accounts have transitioned from an interpersonal communication tool to a business-to-consumer communication channel in the past decade. Emails that come to personal email accounts are largely from businesses and often inspire users to look for information beyond the message, such as a product's details on an online store. This project employed mixed-method research to discover what these information needs are and what contextual factors may affect them.

However, little is known about how the mechanism of PNAs supports populations who need resources from these new connections.

  description: "The digital sharing economy has introduced opportunities for economic growth, productivity, and technological innovation. However, the adoption of sharing economy applications may be inaccessible to certain demographics, including older adults, low-income adults, and individuals who are not college educated. This research investigates how the demographic factors, and the other two key factors - trust, and technology proficiency, are associated with an individual's participation in the sharing economy."
